### GO-KART
I'm working on an electric go kart outside of class. Of course, I have the option of buying a go-kart kit on amazon, but that is nowhere near as fun as designing (most) things from scratch and putting it together with pride of ownership. 

Starting from basic automotive components - the wheels, motor, battery, steering, and breaks - which I've purchased from ebay, I'm building a car chassis that will comfortably fit me and all the components. Making the right selection required me to first delineate a set of objectives and then perform calculations to derive detailed specifications. For example, my desired "maximum speed" and "# miles on full charge" informed battery capacity and motor power. 

An interesting aspect of the chassis design is the ergononomics. I need to make things comfortable for myself, otherwise I increase the risk of getting into an accident if I'm agitated while driving! This project has given me a first-hand experience with the crich concept of "design for ergonomics". 

This project is currently in progress; so far, I've been able to make a semi-detailed SOLIDWORKS model of my car, with close-to-actual dimensions for each of the components.
